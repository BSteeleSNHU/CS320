How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
  - I ensure that my code is functional, through various tests that are compatible with my intended functionality. Testing my code allows me to ensure that I am meeting the ever-changing requirements set forth by the end user of the application. Making sure to not stray from the requirements gives me the ability to ensure that the customer's needs are being met, and I am not scope creeping on the project. 

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
  - I interpret user needs through various forms of requirments gathering and analysis. Gathing requirements should be an ongoing, agile process, where the user is able to change the requirements at any given point, and the development team can adjust to meet these needs. Consistent communication with the user is the key to making sure that all requirements are satisfied at the end of a project. 

How do I approach designing software?
  - I approach designing software in an iterative manner. An iterative approach allows me to focus on a single requirement at a time, to ensure that I have the desired functionality within the application for this requirement. Once the functionality is reached, I can work on incorporating the next component of the application, thus expanding the capabilities of the application.
